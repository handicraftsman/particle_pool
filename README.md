(1024 * Etc.nprocessors).times do |i|
  # Create some tasks
  t = ParticlePool::Task.new do |n|
    raise 'fib not defined for negative numbers' if n < 0
    nv, ov = 1, 0
    n.times do
      nv, ov = nv + ov, nv
      Fiber.yield
    end
    $arr << ov
    $sz += 1
    ov
  end

  # And push them into the pool.
  p.push(t, i)
end

# You can wait for tasks to finish!
t = ParticlePool::Task.new do
  sleep 16
  'Hello, World!'
end
p.push(t)

puts t.await

# Wait for all results to appear
while $sz != (1024 * Etc.nprocessors) do
  sleep 1
end

# Sum results and print the final result
puts $arr.reduce(:+)
